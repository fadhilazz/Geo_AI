GEOCHEMICAL SURVEY REPORT
SEMURUP GEOTHERMAL FIELD
==========================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
====================
This report presents the results of geochemical sampling and analysis conducted 
at the Semurup geothermal field in Jambi, Sumatra, Indonesia.

2. SAMPLING METHODOLOGY
=======================
- Sample collection: 5 hot spring locations
- Analysis parameters: Temperature, pH, conductivity, major ions
- Sampling depth: Surface to -200m
- Analysis method: Standard geochemical laboratory procedures

3. RESULTS
==========
Sample Locations:
- SEM001: Coordinates (758138, 9777737), Temperature 85°C, pH 7.2
- SEM002: Coordinates (758200, 9777800), Temperature 92°C, pH 6.8
- SEM003: Coordinates (758150, 9777750), Temperature 78°C, pH 7.5
- SEM004: Coordinates (758180, 9777780), Temperature 88°C, pH 7.0
- SEM005: Coordinates (758220, 9777820), Temperature 95°C, pH 6.9

4. GEOCHEMICAL INTERPRETATION
=============================
- High silica concentrations (98-158 mg/L) indicate reservoir temperatures
- Na-K geothermometry suggests reservoir temperatures of 180-220°C
- Cl-SO4 ratios indicate mixing with shallow groundwater
- High temperature samples (>90°C) show potential for geothermal development

5. RECOMMENDATIONS
==================
- Continue monitoring of high-temperature springs
- Conduct additional sampling at deeper levels
- Implement geochemical monitoring program
- Consider drilling targets based on geochemical anomalies

6. CONCLUSIONS
==============
The geochemical survey indicates favorable conditions for geothermal development
at the Semurup field. High temperatures and favorable geochemical signatures
suggest the presence of a viable geothermal reservoir.
